[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/mongoose-gridfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/mongoose-gridfs)

mongoose gridfs on top of [gridfs-stream](https://github.com/aheckmann/gridfs-stream)

*Note!: Ensure mongoose connection before use*

## Installation
```sh
$ npm install --save mongoose mongoose-gridfs
```

## Usage
```js
var fs = require('fs');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

//mongoose connect
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

//instantiate mongoose-gridfs
var gridfs = require('mongoose-gridfs')({
  collection:'attachments',
  model:'Attachment',
  mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection
});

//obtain a model
Attachment = gridfs.model;

//create or save a file
Attachment.write({
  filename:'sample.txt', 
  contentType:'text/plain'
  }, 
  fs.createReadStream('/some/path/sample.txt'), 
  function(error, createdFile){
    ...
});

//for larger file size
//read a file and receive a stream
var stream  = Attachment.readById(<objectid>);

//for smaller file size
//read a file and receive a buffer
Attachment.readById(<objectid>, function(error, buffer){
  ...
});

//remove file details and its content from gridfs
Attachment.unlinkById(<objectid>, function(error, unlinkedAttachment){
  ...
});
```

## API
`mongoose-gridfs` wrap [gridfs-stream](https://github.com/aheckmann/gridfs-stream) to provide valid mongoose `schema` and `model` to use with [MongoDB GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/gridfs/).

Each instance of `mongoose-gridfs` is binded to a specific `GridFS collection` and `mongoose model` or `schema` by using options.

### Options
- `collection` a root collection to use in GridFS. default to `fs`
- `model` a model name to use in mongoose. default to `File`

Example
```js
//instantiate mongoose-gridfs
var gridfs = require('mongoose-gridfs')({
  collection:'attachments',
  model:'Attachment'
});
```

### Schema & Model
To obtain underlying model use
```js
var Attachment = gridfs.model
```

To obtain underlying schema for self model registration use
```js
var AttachmentSchema = gridfs.schema;

//attach plugins
//ensure indexes

//register and export a model
module.export = mongoose.model('Attachment', AttachmentSchema);
```

### Static Methods

#### `write(fileDetails:Object, stream:Readable, done(error, createdFile))`
Write a readable stream into gridfs storage

##### Example
```js
Attachment.write({
filename:'sample.txt',
contentType:'text/plain'
},
fs.createReadStream('/some/path/sample.txt'),
function(error, savedAttachment){
  ...
});
```

#### `readById(objectid:ObjectId, [done(error, fileContent)]):Stream`
Read a file content from gridfs storage.

##### Example for smaller file size
```js
Attachment.readById(<objectid>, function(error, content){
  ...
})
```

##### Example for larger file size
```js
var stream = Attachment.readById(<objectid>);

stream.on('error', fn);

stream.on('data', fn);

stream.on('close', fn);
```

#### `unlinkById(objectid:ObjectId, done(error, unlinkedFile))`
Remove file details and its content from underlying gridfs collection.

##### Example
```js
Attachment.unlinkById(<objectid>, function(error, unlinkedAttachment){
  ...
});

or

Attachment.unlink(<objectid>, function(error, unlinkedAttachment){
  ...
});
```

### Instance Methods

#### `write(stream:Readable, done(error, createdFile))`
Write a readable stream into gridfs storage

##### Example
```js
var attachment = new Attachment({
  filename:'sample.txt',
  contentType:'text/plain'
});

attachment.write(
fs.createReadStream('/some/path/sample.txt'),
function(error, savedAttachment){
  ...
});
```

#### `read([done(error, fileContent)]):Stream`
Read a file content from gridfs storage.

##### Example for smaller file size
```js
attachment.read(function(error, content){
  ...
})
```

##### Example for larger file size
```js
var stream = attachment.read();

stream.on('error', fn);

stream.on('data', fn);

stream.on('close', fn);
```

#### `unlink(done(error, unlinkedFile))`
Remove file details and its content from underlying gridfs collection.

##### Example
```js
attachment.unlink(<objectid>, function(error, unlinkedAttachment){
  ...
});
```
